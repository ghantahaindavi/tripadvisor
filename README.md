# üß† TripAdvisor Hotel Review Classification

This project focuses on classifying hotel reviews from TripAdvisor into different sentiment categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

## üìå Project Objective

The goal is to build a multi-class text classification model that can predict the sentiment (rating) of a given review. This can help businesses understand customer opinions and improve their services based on feedback.

## üîç Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed null values
   - Text preprocessing (lowercase, punctuation removal, stopwords removal, etc.)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized rating distributions
   - WordClouds for frequent words per rating

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Applied TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text to numerical features

4. **Model Building**
   - Trained multiple classifiers
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

5. **Model Comparison**
   - Compared model performance to select the best classifier
